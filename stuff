To enhance your experience when running Fedora 41 on Hyper-V, enabling Enhanced Session Mode (ESM) is highly recommended. ESM provides features such as dynamic desktop resizing, clipboard sharing, and improved device support, leading to a more seamless integration between the host and guest systems. Here's a step-by-step guide to configure Fedora 41 for Enhanced Session Mode:

1. Install Necessary Packages:

Begin by installing the hyperv-tools, xrdp, and xrdp-selinux packages. The hyperv-tools package contains tools and scripts useful for Hyper-V guests. 
PACKAGES.FEDORAPROJECT.ORG

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo dnf install hyperv-tools xrdp xrdp-selinux
2. Configure xRDP:

Modify the /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini file to set up xrdp for communication over the Virtual Socket (vsock) and adjust security settings for optimal performance within a local environment.

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo sed -i 's/port=3389/port=vsock:\/\/-1:3389/' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
sudo sed -i 's/security_layer=negotiate/security_layer=rdp/' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
sudo sed -i 's/crypt_level=high/crypt_level=none/' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
sudo sed -i 's/bitmap_compression=true/bitmap_compression=false/' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
3. Enable and Start xRDP Services:

Configure xrdp and its session manager to start immediately and on system boot.

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl enable --now xrdp
sudo systemctl enable --now xrdp-sesman
4. Adjust Firewall Settings:

Open the necessary port for xrdp to allow connections.

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=3389/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
5. Configure Hyper-V Enhanced Session Mode:

Shut down your Fedora virtual machine. On the Windows host, open an elevated PowerShell prompt and set the Enhanced Session Transport Type to HvSocket for your VM. Replace <VM_NAME> with the name of your virtual machine.

powershell
Copy
Edit
Set-VM -VMName <VM_NAME> -EnhancedSessionTransportType HvSocket
To confirm the setting:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Get-VM <VM_NAME> | Select-Object EnhancedSessionTransportType
The output should display HvSocket as the transport type.

6. Start the Virtual Machine:

Power on your Fedora VM. You should now be prompted to select your desired display resolution, indicating that Enhanced Session Mode is active. Log in using your Fedora credentials.

By following these steps, you should experience improved integration and usability when running Fedora 41 on Hyper-V. For a detailed walkthrough, you can refer to Matthew Sanabria's guide on configuring Hyper-V Enhanced Session Mode with Fedora.
