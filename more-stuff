Overview
Understand the GitLab API Endpoints: We'll use GitLab's API to trigger the manual job.

Generate a Trigger URL: Create a URL that, when accessed, triggers the manual job.

Include the URL in the MR Comment: Add the generated URL to the comment posted by the first job.

Handle Authentication: Ensure the user has the necessary permissions to trigger the job.

Security Considerations: Be mindful of exposing trigger tokens or sensitive data.

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Understand the GitLab API Endpoints
GitLab provides an API endpoint to trigger manual actions in a pipeline. You can use the Pipeline Jobs API to run a manual job.

Endpoint to Run a Job:

http
POST /projects/:id/jobs/:job_id/play
:id: The project ID or URL-encoded path of the project.

:job_id: The ID of the job you want to trigger.

2. Generate a Trigger URL
You can construct a URL that represents this API call. For example:

text
https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/:id/jobs/:job_id/play
3. Retrieve Necessary IDs in Your Pipeline
In your first job, you need to retrieve:

Project ID ($CI_PROJECT_ID)

Job ID of the Manual Job

Fetching the Job ID of the Manual Job
Since the downstream pipeline creates the manual job, you need to fetch its job ID. You can do this by calling the Pipelines API to get the jobs of the downstream pipeline.

Example:
bash
# Get the latest pipeline ID for the current merge request
PIPELINE_ID=$(curl --silent --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" "$CI_API_V4_URL/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/pipelines?sha=$CI_COMMIT_SHA&ref=$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME" | jq '.[0].id')

# Get the list of jobs for the pipeline
JOB_LIST=$(curl --silent --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" "$CI_API_V4_URL/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/pipelines/$PIPELINE_ID/jobs")

# Extract the job ID of the manual job
MANUAL_JOB_ID=$(echo "$JOB_LIST" | jq '.[] | select(.name=="name_of_manual_job" and .status=="manual") | .id')

echo "Manual Job ID: $MANUAL_JOB_ID"
Replace "name_of_manual_job" with the actual name of your manual job.

4. Construct the Trigger URL
Now, construct the URL to trigger the manual job:

bash
TRIGGER_URL="$CI_API_V4_URL/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/jobs/$MANUAL_JOB_ID/play"
5. Include the URL in the MR Comment
Now, in your first job, you can add this URL to the comment posted to the MR.

Example Comment Body:
bash
COMMENT_BODY=$(cat <<EOM
The process has completed successfully.

You can proceed by triggering the manual job [here]($TRIGGER_URL).

Thank you!
EOM
)
6. Post the Comment to the Merge Request
bash
# Construct the JSON payload using jq
JSON_PAYLOAD=$(jq -n --arg body "$COMMENT_BODY" '{body: $body}')

# Post the comment
curl --request POST \
     --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data "$JSON_PAYLOAD" \
     "$CI_API_V4_URL/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/merge_requests/$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID/notes"
7. Handle Authentication
For the user to trigger the manual job via the link, they need to be authenticated and have the necessary permissions.

Authenticated Users: Users who are logged into GitLab and have access to the project can trigger the job using the link.

Permissions: Ensure that the users have the developer role or higher in the project to trigger manual jobs.

8. Security Considerations
Avoid Exposing Private Tokens: Do not include private tokens or sensitive information in the URL.

Use Session Authentication: Since users will be clicking the link from the MR page, their session will be used for authentication.

Job-Specific Tokens (Optional): If you need to authenticate the API call without user interaction, consider using job tokens or other secure methods.

Complete Example
Hereâ€™s how you can put it all together in your .gitlab-ci.yml:

First Job:
yaml
stages:
  - process
  - manual_step

first_job:
  stage: process
  script:
    - echo "Processing..."
    # Simulate some processing
    - sleep 5
    # Fetch the manual job ID
    - |
      # Get the latest pipeline ID
      PIPELINE_ID=$(curl --silent --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" "$CI_API_V4_URL/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/pipelines?ref=$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME" | jq '.[0].id')
      echo "Pipeline ID: $PIPELINE_ID"
      # Get the list of jobs
      JOB_LIST=$(curl --silent --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" "$CI_API_V4_URL/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/pipelines/$PIPELINE_ID/jobs")
      # Extract the manual job ID
      MANUAL_JOB_ID=$(echo "$JOB_LIST" | jq '.[] | select(.name=="second_job" and .status=="manual") | .id')
      echo "Manual Job ID: $MANUAL_JOB_ID"
      # Construct the trigger URL
      TRIGGER_URL="$CI_API_V4_URL/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/jobs/$MANUAL_JOB_ID/play"
      # Create the comment body
      COMMENT_BODY=$(cat <<EOM
The process has completed successfully.

You can proceed by triggering the manual job [here]($TRIGGER_URL).

Thank you!
EOM
      )
      # Post the comment
      JSON_PAYLOAD=$(jq -n --arg body "$COMMENT_BODY" '{body: $body}')
      curl --request POST \
           --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
           --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
           --data "$JSON_PAYLOAD" \
           "$CI_API_V4_URL/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/merge_requests/$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID/notes"

  variables:
    GIT_STRATEGY: none
  only:
    - merge_requests

second_job:
  stage: manual_step
  script:
    - echo "Manual job executed."
  when: manual
  allow_failure: false
Important Notes
Use Job Tokens Instead of Personal Access Tokens (PATs):

Personal Access Tokens should not be hardcoded or exposed. It's better to use a CI Job Token ($CI_JOB_TOKEN), which is more secure.

Update the API calls to use JOB-TOKEN instead of PRIVATE-TOKEN:

bash
curl --header "JOB-TOKEN: $CI_JOB_TOKEN" ...
URL Encoding:

Ensure that any variables included in the URL are properly URL-encoded to avoid issues.

Permissions:

Users must have the appropriate permissions to run the manual job.

Pipeline Dependencies:

Ensure that your pipeline is configured correctly so that the manual job is scheduled and waiting when you attempt to fetch its ID.

Potential Challenges and Solutions
Fetching the Correct Pipeline and Job IDs:

Challenge: The downstream pipeline may not have been fully created when the first job runs.

Solution: Introduce a small delay or loop to wait for the downstream pipeline and manual job to be created.

bash
# Wait for the manual job to appear
for i in {1..10}; do
  # Fetch the job as before
  # Break if MANUAL_JOB_ID is not empty
  if [[ -n "$MANUAL_JOB_ID" ]]; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 2
done
Authentication Errors:

Challenge: If users are not logged in or lack permissions, they cannot trigger the job.

Solution: Ensure that users are aware they need to be logged in and have the necessary permissions.

Security Concerns:

Ensure that sensitive tokens are stored securely in GitLab CI/CD variables with masking and protected settings as appropriate.

Pipeline Configuration:

Make sure that the stages and jobs are set up correctly in your pipeline configuration to avoid race conditions.

Alternative Approach: Direct Link to Manual Job
If constructing the API trigger URL proves complex, you can provide a link to the pipeline page where the user can manually trigger the job.

Example:
bash
# Construct the URL to the manual job in the GitLab UI
JOB_URL="$CI_PROJECT_URL/-/jobs/$MANUAL_JOB_ID"

# Update the comment body
COMMENT_BODY=$(cat <<EOM
The process has completed successfully.

You can proceed by triggering the manual job [here]($JOB_URL).

Thank you!

Advantages:

Simplifies the process by directing users to the GitLab UI.

Users can review the job details before triggering it.

Disadvantages:

Requires users to navigate away from the MR page.

Final Thoughts
By integrating the ability to trigger the manual job directly from the merge request comment, you streamline the workflow and improve efficiency. Remember to handle authentication securely and ensure users have the necessary permissions.
