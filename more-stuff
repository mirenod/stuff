Hereâ€™s an example of how to set up a systemd timer:

Create a systemd service file (e.g., /etc/systemd/system/my_service.service):
[Unit]
Description=My Custom Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/my_script.sh

Create a systemd timer file (e.g., /etc/systemd/system/my_service.timer):
[Unit]
Description=Runs my_service periodically

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 03:30:00
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
In this example, the OnCalendar directive specifies that the service should run every day at 3:30 AM. You can adjust the OnCalendar value to fit your desired schedule.
Reload systemd:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Enable and start the timer:
sudo systemctl enable my_service.timer
sudo systemctl start my_service.timer

Check the status of the timer:
sudo systemctl status my_service.timer

By using a systemd timer, you can schedule your script to run at specific intervals, similar to how you would with a cron job.
